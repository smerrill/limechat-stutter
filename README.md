# About

This is a theme for [LimeChat](https://github.com/psychs/limechat).

It uses a monospaced font such that code (or ASCII art) will look great. You will need to install the [Mensch font](http://robey.lag.net/2010/06/21/mensch-font.html) to put this theme to good use.

The theme itself is based on the excellent [Whisper theme](https://github.com/jezdez/limechat-whisper).

# Great IRC Programs

If you use LimeChat and thus IRC, you should really consider using [ZNC](https://github.com/znc/znc) and [bitlbee](http://bitlbee.org/main.php/news.r.html).

# Ceci n'est pas une chat

LimeChat is not LimeCat.
